The R script file group33_ass2_impl.R requires the following files in the current working directory
test_data_nolabels.csv
train_data_withlabels.csv

It will output a pred_labels.csv to the current working directory. 
Please note the index column is named 'col_index' per the recently updated assignment specifications. 
If this is not the case please comment lines 360 to 363 before running to retain the index column as 'id'.

The script should run as a standalone file. It will install all required packages at runtime. Thank you
